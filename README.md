working clock on an arduino uno, 24 hours format, plug it in clone the code and u are ready to go.
 edit timedelay in the second row to freely edit the seconds which the clock is supposed to count forwards (60000milliseconds equals 1 minute)
dont worry if vs studio is showing some errors its all working
